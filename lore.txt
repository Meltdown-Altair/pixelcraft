Mechanical Life

Catapult:
Life on Serpulo was harsh after the inccident of the first mass extinction. Nothing could survive. Or so we thought.

Trebuche:
There was life flourishing in the pockets of water scattered throughout Sepulo. They had adapted to the harsh circumstances, growing metallic scales.

Cannon:
Eventualy, after a few hundred years or so, life adapted to the surface's conditions. Not biological life, but mechanical life.

Howitzer:
Mechs which resembled inscects, fish, birds and more were formed.


The lore (In order of events)

Stone
//This is from the perspective of the crux, and they don't know what really causes the stone to glow as they can only percieve what is being simulated.
Surprisingly, each universe incarnation might be different from the last one in not just it's formation, but it's rules. Apparently in this iteration, radioactive materials take an extremely short time to react as processes down at the quantum level are sped up. How do we know this? The last iteration had left behind indestructible information before it was reborn. Information on how nuclear reactions worked. There was one exception that exists however. In the stone of planets, there remains a glowing property. Radioactive materiels in the stone of each planet decaying extremely slowly. We are able to see at night because of this. It emits enough light to dimly light up the surface of many planets. The light is on the lower end of the spectrum, still on the visible portion making it usable for a light source deep in space. This was normal to us. The glowing stone was a blessing to have and we valued it until we found better ways of lighting up our encampments.

Templura 

Taconite Pulveriser:
During the volitile stage of the universe, Templura and Serpulo, fated to meet, crashed into eachother with such force, the shockwave blew away the other planets in the system. The remains of Templura formed a small rocky planet while Sepulo, barely held together after the impact slowly reformed into a new world. Now it's ours. Come, our work is not done yet.

Ioniser:
However, there was a small problem with the formation of the planets. Held together by nothing but gravity, Templura's surface was jagged, unlike other planets which looked rounded, almost perfectly spherical.

Sand Reversal Unit:
Serpulo's surface was cooling down. It had a magnetic field caused by the swirling of molten metal at the planet's core, protecting gasses from intense solar winds. However, as there was high volcanic activity, the surface never formed an ocean. There were isolated pockets of water on it but no grand seas for sailors to explore.

Mechanical Life:
//This is from the perspective of the crux, and they don't know what really caused mechanical life as they can only perceive what is being simulated.
Sepulo was a lush planet full of life, which is evident due to the amount of coal present. That all changed one day. A mass extinction that wiped out nearly every lifeform on Sepulo happened, and there was almost no hope for it to recover it's biodiversity. It never did. Most land based creatures were wiped out after the initial freeze and the ones that survived died of starvation. The lakes were frozen and larger bodies of water covered in a thick layer of ice. These small isolated pockets of water would give birth to new life. Metallic beasts which roamed Sepulo acting like the fauna from before.

Core Beacon
Years ago, a great flood overwhelmed Serpulo and rusted the grounds. Some 1000 years later, when they returned, a great discovery was made.

Rusty Core
The predecessor of an old core was found and quickly scanned for it's structural integrity. blueprints were recovered from it, revealing the history of Sepulo's environment. 

Rusty Alpha:
After it was found, the slag wars began. Sepulo was going through a period of increased volcanic activity due to weak spots leftover from the planet's formation.

Rusty Delta:
Some went rogue. Others tried to help their relatives survive. In the end, it didn't matter though. The only places safe were now the ever increasing amount of caves.

slag

Volitile generator:
When they first discovered scrap, they didn't know what to think. One suggested that something happened, though the others dismissed the idea as blasphemy. 

Coal compresser:
Eventualy the bots had found out that it had many metals in it, even the valued thorium that kept their reactors fueled. For now, they tried to figure out how to extract the metals directly. Nothing they tried worked.  One of the bots decided to melt the scrap. They said that the idea was pointless, as these were ancient fossils which they were studying. The bot's name was dart. They were banished to the farlands and told never to come back again, with threats to be shot on sight.

Crux using pixelcraft tech

They had found the schematics to the ancient tech of our grandfathers . The accomplishment we all this time was searching for , now discovered by our own foes . They had scanned all the forgotten tech upon our once lush homeworld . An unanticipated move by our enemies , perhaps they knew it all along ? Templura , the planet we had been vying control for millenias since our arrival to the Haven , was perhaps known by many upon those who had lived through the cruel trip to this planet . It doesn't matter , now , all our resources are on shortage , and we must retake the planet before they can build a permament base .

Dunescape crags

Lava and magma floods the area on massive canals 
Char-dusted air is chock full with the ever-so-occasional char smell 
The Savestas (now known as Derelict when their downfall happened) once used a mighty superweapon here during one of their last stands againt the invaders . Perhaps salvaging their tech from a slaggy demise would be good to preserve this cultuure .

The infestation

Spores , the artificial life that once was the savior of Serpulo , now turned into the destructor of life . 
The crux didn't know it but they were being controlled, and the "accident" happened because the crux's spore production facilities were built in a spot where dialect would attack which released the spores. They knew it would happen and it impacted dialect heavily, since they relied on natural sources to make power. This would be one of many blows to dialect as they slowly lost control of Sepulo.
Templura's life was resilient enough to fight back against the spores that happened to land on Templura from the crux's launch. There was one spot on Templura which was almost perfectly suited for the spores to inhabit however, and are the main source of spores on Templura.

The Grand Prophecy's Last Prediction

Serpulo , now our race's last core world , is all that is left of our grand empire .
Millenias ago , our race was a proud and glorius country , standing uncontested in the void of space . There , we had buildings shimmering in gold bright and beautiful spacecraft flying in our spaceports in the orbits of our countless worlds in our domain . Templura - as it was called , was once the home of our vast empire , housing the statues and monuments of great leaders in our empire's history , shining bright above our home planet . In one of the rooms , there housed an ancient book , called The Grand Prophecy . The book is written in a god-who-knows language that was only translated when one of the staff had opened it fully , letting the book to unravel it's ancient horrors to eat his soul . It ate the staff's soul , and in exchange , let the contents be translated into our language . The opening of the book made a shockwave to emitted a wide screeching with ancient voices speaking , muttering the words of "The Prophecy" , "It shall be thy last dream" and the final "It shall be thy undoing"

Our leaders would slowly walk into the room , seeing the ancient book opened , and a dead body lying on the ground
